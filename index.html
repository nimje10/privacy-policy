Privacy Policy for Amadeus Chat Assistant
Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains how Amadeus Chat Assistant ("we", "our", or "extension") collects, uses, and protects information when you use our Chrome extension.

Information Collection and Use
Our extension may collect and store:

Queries you submit to the chatbot
Chat history for context preservation
Extension preferences you set
Limited browsing activity only on Amadeus-related pages when the extension is active
We use this information solely to:

Provide relevant responses about Amadeus commands
Improve the assistant's accuracy and performance
Save your preferences for a better user experience
Data Storage
All data is stored locally on your device using Chrome's storage API. We do not transmit your queries or chat history to external servers except when necessary to process queries through our AI service.

Third-Party Services
Our extension may use AI services to process your queries about Amadeus commands. Only your specific question is sent to these services, not your browsing history or personal information.

Data Retention
Your chat history and preferences remain stored until you clear them through the extension settings or uninstall the extension.

User Rights
You can:

Clear your chat history at any time through the extension interface
Uninstall the extension to remove all stored data
Updates to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy as we improve our extension. We will notify users of any significant changes.
